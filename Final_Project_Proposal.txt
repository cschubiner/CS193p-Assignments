What am I doing?
	I will be building an Audiobook playing application. 

	Features:
		- Open audio files gotten through other applications (register itself as an audio player with the system, so other applications can choose this application as an "Open in..." option for audio files)
		- Position in each audio file will be saved
		- Swipe gestures to skip forward and back in the audio file. 
		- Tap gesture to pause/play audio
		- Browse files and allow for creation of new folders and moving files between folders

	Possible extra features:
		- Browse the internet using a built-in UIWebView to download audio files
		- Sleep timer (stop playing audio after a specified period of time)
		- Customize gestures
		- Light/dark theme

What parts of iOS will it use?
	- UIWebView to browse internet
	- Core Data (???) to store downloaded audio files 
	- Core Data to store last-played positions in audio files
	- Core Audio to play audio files
	- Gesture recognizers to recognize gestures
	- UITableViews to display file directories
	- NSTimer for sleep timer
	- Backgrounding to play audio in the background
